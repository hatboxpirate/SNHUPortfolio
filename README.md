How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The best way to understand what users need from a program is to hear directly from them. User feedback can direct where to focus efforts in development. User stories can help with this by defining what user expectations are for a given program.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  The first step to developing a program is to determine what the program is expected to do. While this may change many times during the development process, we need baseline to start. I can see the usefullness of many aspects of agile, from the product backlog, user stories, and sprints being meaningful ways to maintain the project and ensure the goals are met.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  No matter their role, communication is one of the most important steps in being a good team member. There can be many roadblocks that prevent a project from finishing as intended, from changes in scope to issues in development, and without clear communication, the team may be left in the dark when these issues arise. By having direct lines of communication across the team, team members can be kept up-to-date of all progress and the project and can shift around to help with issues as they arise.
